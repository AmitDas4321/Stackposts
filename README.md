# Stackposts - Continuous Signup Script

## Overview
Stackposts is a Python-based tool designed to automate user signups on a specified domain. It checks the disallowed domains from Firebase and generates random user information such as full names, usernames, emails, and phone numbers to simulate signups.

## Features
- **Domain Setup**: Allows users to input and change domains.
- **Random User Generation**: Dynamically generates random user details for each signup attempt.
- **Firebase Integration**: Ensures that only allowed domains are used for signups.
- **Logs Successful Signups**: All successful signups are logged in a domain-specific log file.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.x**: The script requires Python 3 or later.
- **Internet Connection**: The script communicates with Firebase to check disallowed domains.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AmitDas4321/Stackposts.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory
Navigate into the cloned project directory:
```bash
cd Stackposts
```

### 3. Install Required Python Libraries
The script requires **`requests`** and **`pyfiglet`**. Install them by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, manually install the dependencies:
```bash
pip install requests pyfiglet
```

## Usage

### Running the Script
To run the script, use the following command in the terminal:
```bash
python3 Stakposts.py
```

### Domain Setup
The script will prompt you to enter the domain for the signup process. It checks if the domain is allowed by verifying against Firebase Realtime Database.

- **If the domain is disallowed**: You will be prompted to enter a different domain.
- **If the domain is allowed**: It will be saved in a `domain.json` file for future use.

### Changing the Domain
If you want to change the domain later:
1. The script will prompt you if you want to update the domain.
2. If you press 'n', it will delete the old domain and ask you to enter a new domain.

### Continuous Signup
The script will continuously generate random signups (e.g., name, username, email, phone number) and send them to the specified domain. It waits for a few seconds before making the next request.

### Logs
The successful signup attempts are logged in a domain-specific JSON file (e.g., `<domain>_signup_log.json`).

### Example Terminal Output:
```bash
Starting continuous signup requests. Press Ctrl+C to stop.
Sent signup request:
  fullname: Rahul Bhattacharya
  username: rahulbhattacharya24
  email: rahulbhattacharya2215@gmail.com
  phone: +919123456789
Response:
  {"status": "success", "message": "Signup successful"}
------------------------------------------------------------
```

## Files
- **Stakposts.py**: Main Python script for continuous signups.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the necessary Python dependencies.
- **domain.json**: Stores the user’s domain for future use.

## How to Use on Different Platforms

### **1. Using the Script on Mac**

On macOS, the process is very similar to using it on Linux. Here's how you can use it:

1. **Install Python 3** (if not already installed):
   - You can check if Python is installed by running:
     ```bash
     python3 --version
     ```
   - If Python is not installed, download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or install it via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):
     ```bash
     brew install python
     ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Navigate to the project folder where you cloned the repository:
     ```bash
     cd Stackposts
     ```
   - Install the required dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip3 install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Run the Script**:
   Execute the script:
   ```bash
   python3 Stakposts.py
   ```

### **2. Using the Script on Termux (Android)**

You can use **Termux**, a Linux environment for Android, to run the script. Follow these steps to set it up on your Android device:

1. **Install Termux** from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux) or [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.termux/).

2. **Install Python**:
   In Termux, you can install Python using:
   ```bash
   pkg update
   pkg install python
   ```

3. **Install Git** (to clone the repository):
   ```bash
   pkg install git
   ```

4. **Clone the Repository**:
   Clone your GitHub repository in Termux:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AmitDas4321/Stackposts.git
   cd Stackposts
   ```

5. **Install Dependencies**:
   Termux doesn’t come with `pip` by default, so install it first:
   ```bash
   pkg install python-pip
   ```

   Then install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. **Run the Script**:
   You can now run the script using:
   ```bash
   python3 Stakposts.py
   ```
